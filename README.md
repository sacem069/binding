Why We Design 

I titled this project “Why We Design” because the three texts I selected—on ugly design, functionalism, and speculative design—each question the role and purpose of design from different angles. Together they create a timeline of how design thinks: breaking norms, serving human needs, and imagining alternative futures. My website holds these perspectives without choosing one over the other, reflecting my own neutral and exploratory approach to the topic.

This conceptual mix shaped the visual language of the site. I used three bold colors (orange, green, and blue) and simple geometric shapes to give each text its own identity. They are not “primary colors,” but they function as distinct, high-contrast anchors that organize the content clearly. The beige background and American Typewriter add a warm, vintage tone, while Verona Serial provides a more refined typographic voice for the main titles.

The black-and-white surf photograph and the pixel-style SVG cursor extend this vintage feeling. My intention was to step away from the gradient-heavy websites common today and instead create a page that feels calm, safe, and inviting—almost analog. A site that doesn’t overwhelm, but gently supports reflection.

Overall, this design expresses a quiet balance between critique, function, and speculation, and it presents my understanding of the central question: why we design.
